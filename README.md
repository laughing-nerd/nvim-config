# Neovim configuration
These are the config files for my Neovim setup

# Plugins that are being used
I am using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to manage the following plugins:

- Colorscheme: [nightowl](https://github.com/haishanh/night-owl.vim)
- File explorer tree: [nvim-tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua)
- Syntax highlighting: [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
- Fuzzy Finder: [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- LSP: [lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim)


*P.S.: 
You should have packer installed on your system. Check out their GitHub to get started.<br>
You should also have Nerd Fonts(Hack) installed and configured in the terminal to view all the icons*
